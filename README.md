# Terminal Seafood Menu

A simple command-line seafood restaurant ordering application written in Python.

## About

This project is a beginner-level Python application that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including user input, string manipulation, and basic program flow. The application allows users to place seafood orders by entering their name and selecting items from a menu.

## What It Demonstrates

- Python `input()` and `print()` functions
- Basic pricing system
- Variable assignment and string manipulation
- Command-line user interaction
- Basic program flow and logic
- Handling user orders and displaying menu items

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the App

```bash
python main.py
```

Or simply run the `.py` file directly in your terminal.

## How It Works

1. Enter your name
2. Receive a personalized greeting
3. Choose from the seafood menu (Shrimp, Crab, Catfish, Flounder, Lobster)
4. Receive order confirmation
5. Order is served

## Future Improvements
